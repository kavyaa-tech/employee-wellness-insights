# 🩺 Employee Wellness & Preventive Healthcare Dashboard

This project explores how data analytics can help organizations monitor employee wellness and promote preventive healthcare.

Built using **Power BI**, the dashboard provides insights into health risks such as high blood pressure, sugar levels, and cholesterol — all simulated using Python.

---

## 📊 Project Highlights

- **Health Snapshot** with KPIs (% of employees with high BP, Sugar, Cholesterol)
- **Risk breakdown** by gender, age group, and location
- **Trends over time** for key health metrics
- **Actionable insights** for HR teams to design effective wellness programs

> Even though the data is simulated, the goal was to build a realistic end-to-end dashboard and practice communicating data-driven insights.
